# SHAP Model Explainability Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) implementation in the Model Explainability section, investigating the methodology, feature importance rankings, and specifically addressing why Temperature appears to have unexpectedly low importance.

## 1. Source Audit

### 1.1 SHAP Implementation Details

**Location**: `backend/calculate_shap_data.py`

**SHAP Method Used**: `shap.TreeExplainer`
- ✅ **Correct Choice**: TreeExplainer is appropriate for XGBoost models
- ✅ **Background Data**: Uses full training set as background (`data=X_train_scaled`)
- ✅ **Implementation**: Standard SHAP TreeExplainer implementation

**Model Configuration**:
```python
XGBRegressor(
    n_estimators=100, 
    max_depth=6, 
    learning_rate=0.1,
    random_state=42, 
    objective='reg:squarederror'
)
```

**Feature Engineering**:
- Temperature: `predicted_temp` (continuous)
- Hour: `time.dt.hour` (0-23)
- Day_of_Week: `time.dt.dayofweek` (0-6)
- Week_of_Month: `(time.dt.day - 1) // 7 + 1` (1-4/5)

**Data Preprocessing**:
- ✅ StandardScaler applied to all features
- ✅ Consistent scaling between training and prediction

### 1.2 Current Feature Importance Rankings

Based on `shap_data_complete.json`:

| Rank | Feature | Importance | Percentage |
|------|---------|------------|------------|
| 1 | Hour | 465.41 | 44.6% |
| 2 | Day_of_Week | 323.91 | 31.0% |
| 3 | Week_of_Month | 220.52 | 21.1% |
| 4 | **Temperature** | **35.41** | **3.4%** |

## 2. Methodological Validation

### 2.1 SHAP Implementation Assessment

**✅ Strengths**:
- Correct explainer type (TreeExplainer for XGBoost)
- Proper background sample selection (full training set)
- Consistent feature scaling
- Mean absolute SHAP values for importance ranking

**⚠️ Areas for Improvement**:
- No cross-validation of SHAP rankings with alternative methods
- Limited analysis of feature interactions
- No assessment of multicollinearity effects

### 2.2 Feature Importance Calculation

**Method**: Mean absolute SHAP values
```python
mean_abs_shap = np.mean(np.abs(self.shap_values), axis=0)
```

**Assessment**: ✅ This is a standard and appropriate method for feature importance ranking.

## 3. Temperature Importance Investigation

### 3.1 Data Characteristics Analysis

**Dataset**: `worst_day_1_2022_01_07_winter_extreme_cold.csv`
- **Time Period**: Winter data (2021-12-17 to 2022-01-07)
- **Sample Size**: 530 hourly observations
- **Season**: Winter extreme cold period

**Temperature Statistics** (from data inspection):
- **Range**: Approximately 2°C to 15°C
- **Average**: ~8-10°C (winter temperatures)
- **Variation**: Limited due to winter season
- **Pattern**: Relatively stable winter temperatures

### 3.2 Why Temperature Has Low Importance

#### **Primary Reason: Limited Temperature Variation**

1. **Seasonal Constraint**: 
   - Data is from a 3-week winter period
   - Temperature range is constrained (~13°C range)
   - Limited variation reduces predictive power

2. **Temporal Dominance**:
   - Hour captures daily patterns (work hours, peak demand)
   - Day_of_Week captures weekly patterns (weekday vs weekend)
   - These temporal features capture most of the systematic variation

3. **Proxy Variable Effect**:
   - Hour and day patterns may indirectly capture temperature effects
   - Winter heating patterns are predictable by time
   - Temperature becomes redundant when time features are present

#### **Supporting Evidence from SHAP Data**

From `shap_data_complete.json` analysis:
- Temperature SHAP values range from -15.7 to +194.2 MW
- Most temperature SHAP values are small (< 50 MW)
- Hour SHAP values show much larger magnitude and consistency

### 3.3 Domain Knowledge Validation

**Expected Temperature Sensitivity**:
- Typical power systems: 50-100 MW per °C in winter
- Heating load increases with lower temperatures
- Cooling load minimal in winter

**Observed Pattern**:
- Temperature coefficient appears reasonable but limited by data range
- Winter period reduces temperature's discriminative power
- Time-based patterns dominate in short-term winter data

## 4. Reasonableness Check

### 4.1 Data Limitations

1. **Temporal Scope**: 3-week winter period limits temperature variation
2. **Seasonal Bias**: Winter data doesn't capture full annual temperature range
3. **Feature Correlation**: Time features may capture temperature patterns

### 4.2 Model Behavior Assessment

**Model Performance** (from code inspection):
- Uses appropriate XGBoost configuration
- Standard preprocessing with scaling
- Reasonable hyperparameters

**SHAP Calculation**:
- Methodologically sound
- Appropriate for tree-based models
- Consistent implementation

## 5. Recommendations

### 5.1 Immediate Actions

1. **Expand Dataset**:
   - Include summer data to capture full temperature range
   - Add seasonal variation (spring, summer, fall, winter)
   - Increase temperature variation for better importance assessment

2. **Alternative Importance Methods**:
   - Implement Permutation Importance as cross-validation
   - Calculate correlation-based importance
   - Use SHAP interaction values to detect feature interactions

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Add temperature-time interaction terms
   - Consider temperature lag features
   - Include heating/cooling degree days

### 5.2 Long-term Improvements

1. **Multi-seasonal Model**:
   - Train on full year of data
   - Include seasonal dummy variables
   - Capture temperature's full impact range

2. **Advanced Analysis**:
   - Partial Dependence Plots for temperature
   - SHAP interaction analysis
   - Feature correlation assessment

3. **Model Validation**:
   - Cross-validate importance rankings
   - Test on different seasons
   - Validate against domain expertise

## 6. Conclusions

### 6.1 SHAP Implementation Assessment

**✅ Methodology is Sound**: The SHAP implementation is technically correct and appropriate for the XGBoost model.

**✅ Calculations are Valid**: Feature importance rankings are computed correctly using mean absolute SHAP values.

### 6.2 Temperature Importance Explanation

**The low temperature importance is REASONABLE given the data constraints**:

1. **Limited Variation**: Winter-only data constrains temperature range
2. **Temporal Dominance**: Hour and day patterns capture most systematic variation
3. **Proxy Effects**: Time features may indirectly capture temperature patterns
4. **Seasonal Context**: Winter heating patterns are predictable by time alone

### 6.3 Key Findings

- SHAP methodology is correctly implemented
- Temperature's low importance is explained by data limitations, not methodological errors
- Time-based features dominate in short-term, single-season data
- Results are consistent with domain knowledge for winter-only datasets

### 6.4 Action Items

1. **High Priority**: Expand dataset to include multiple seasons
2. **Medium Priority**: Implement alternative importance methods for validation
3. **Low Priority**: Add temperature interaction features

**The current SHAP analysis is methodologically sound but limited by the winter-only dataset scope.**
